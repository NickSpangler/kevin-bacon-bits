## Usage

The Home page has a flippable card that explains the three main features of the site.

`Six Degrees Search` allows for a search between any two actors in our database and will return a linkable path between them. Currently this feature allows for four degrees of separation.

`Six Degrees Challenge` is a feature that's coming soon, and will allow a user to enter an actor and a degree  of separation (1 - 6), and they will then be told which actor to link them to, the number of degrees specified ,through a series of connections.

`Filmography Challenge` puts your knowledge to the test! Select an actor, you'll be presented with five movie posters, and you have to click the movie that actor was in. Keep going until you get one wrong!
